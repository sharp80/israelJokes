ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* proguard.cfg
* publish\
* publish\CampImage_1024x500.png
* publish\IsraeliJokes17.apk
* publish\IsraeliJokes18.apk
* publish\Thumbs.db
* publish\brazilJokes.apk
* publish\jokes_icon2.png
* publish\jokes_icon2.zip
* publish\keys.txt
* publish\premote.png
* publish\screen_addJoke.png
* publish\screen_categories.png
* publish\screen_category.png
* publish\screen_joke.png
* publish\screen_joke_image.png
* publish\trivia-gmae-key.keystore

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* libs\android-support-v13.jar => app\libs\android-support-v13.jar
* libs\inneractiveAdSDK.jar => app\libs\inneractiveAdSDK.jar
* lint.xml => app\lint.xml
* res\ => app\src\main\res\
* src\ => app\src\main\java\
* top_bg.PNG => top_bg.png

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
